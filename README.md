# OurAirports

This Rails application displays the airport information provided by OurAirports (at http://ourairports.com/data/).

My hope is to make it a very convenient tool for exploring the airport information, including searching, sorting, and geographical features (e.g. show the airports within x miles of a given latitude/longitude).

The project home is on Github at https://github.com/keithrbennett/our_airports.
